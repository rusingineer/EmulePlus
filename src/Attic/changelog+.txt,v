CHANGE:  eDonkey is now emulated to anyone except eMule. I had to adapt this since mlDonkey changed their 
                 system how to recognize the other mlDonkey clients. Their new system seems a little mor complex.
                 I had no time by now to analyze it deeply. But this patch should do it for now and eMule will not have
                 any disadvantages. [Maverick]
CHANGE: Initial port to .25 basecode. A lot is still missing..[Cax2/kuchin]

CHANGE:  eDonkey is now emulated to anyone except eMule. I had to adapt this since mlDonkey changed their

                 I had no time by now to analyze it deeply. But this patch should do it for now and eMule will not have
                 any disadvantages. [Maverick]
